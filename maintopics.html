      <h3>1.- OOP vs Functional: The definitive comments</h3>
      <p>
        Object oriented programing and functional programing are two different
        paradigms when it comes to software arquitecture and development in
        general. Let's talk about each one for a moment.
      </p>
      <h4>Object Oriented Programing</h4>
      <p>
        Object oriented programing means using the object as the building block
        of our program, an object being a collection of defined properties and
        methods inside a scope. Scope being athe arbitrary limit or boundary of
        the object.
      </p>
      <p>
        A lot of languages are designed to work with this paradigm in mind and
        provide tools to do so, like classes and different variable types. Java
        and C# are the classic examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before we explain the Functional paradigm it's appropriate to explain
        what are properties and methods in this context. A Property is a value,
        which can be represented by a number, a string, another object, etc..,
        while a Method is a function that executes inside the scope of the
        object. Leading us to our next subject.
      </p>
      <h4>Functional Programing</h4>
      <p>
        A function is set of commands executed whenever the function is invoked.
        These commands will be part ot the function's body. You can call a
        function inside another one to create more complex functions. Some
        functions return stuff
