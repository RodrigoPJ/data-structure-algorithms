## 1.- OOP vs Functional: The definitive comments

  Object oriented programing and functional programing are two different paradigms
when it comes to software arquitecture and development in general. Let's talk 
about each one for a moment. 

### Object Oriented Programing

  Object oriented programing means using the object as the building block of our
program, an object being a collection of defined properties and methods inside 
a **scope**.Scope being an arbitrary limit or boundary within the object.

  A lot of languages are designed to work with this paradigm in mind and provide 
tools to do so, like classes and different variable types. Java and C# are the
classic examples.

  Before we explain the Functional paradigm it's appropriate to explain what are
properties and methods in this context. A **Property** is a value, which can be
represented by a number, a string, another object, etc.., while a **Method** is 
a function that executes inside the scope of the object. Leading us to our next 
subject.

### Functional Programing

  A function is set of commands executed whenever the function is invoked.
