      <h3>1.- OOP vs Functional: The definitive comments</h3>
      <p>
        Object oriented programing and functional programing are two different
        paradigms when it comes to software arquitecture and development in
        general. Let's talk about each one for a moment.
      </p>
      <h4>Object Oriented Programing</h4>
      <p>
        Object oriented programing means using the object as the building block
        of our program, an object being a collection of defined properties and
        methods inside a scope. Scope being athe arbitrary limit or boundary of
        the object.
      </p>
      <p>
        A lot of languages are designed to work with this paradigm in mind and
        provide tools to do so, like classes and different variable types. Java
        and C# are the classic examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before we explain the Functional paradigm it's appropriate to explain
        what are properties and methods in this context. A Property is a value,
        which can be represented by a number, a string, another object, etc..,
        while a Method is a function that executes inside the scope of the
        object. Leading us to our next subject.
      </p>
      <h4>Functional Programing</h4>
      <p>
        A function is set of commands executed whenever the function is invoked.
        These commands will be part ot the function's body. You can call a
        function inside another one to create more complex functions. Some
        functions return stuff some don't. Thy execute inside a scope.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are not exclusive, functions that belong to a certain object are
        called methods. However, when talking about programing languages some
        are better equipped to deal with one or the other. With classes, which
        are helpful to create and identify objects or with other tools.
        Javascript was designed as a functional language but has been
        incorporating OOP capabilities with time, with ES6 including the keyword
        class to make it more friendly for developers used to work OOP. I'd say
        OOP is a bigger block for building software than Functions, but you need
        both.

        2.- Complexity analysis; Big O notation
      </h3>
      <p>
        In computer science analysis of algorithms is the determination of
        computational complexity of algorithms. How much time, storage and
        computational power they need to achieve the desired solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is common to estimate their complexity in the asymptotic sense, like
        testing for very large inputs. Big O notation, Big-omega notation and
        big-theta notation are used. For instance, binary search is said to run
        in a number of steps proportional to the logarithm of the length of the
        sorted list being searched, or in O(log(n)), colloquially "in
        logarithmic time".
      </p>
      <p>
        Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting
        behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular
        value or infinity.
      </p>
      <p>
        In computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms
        according to how their running time or space requirements grow as the
        input size grows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Big O notation characterizes functions according to their growth rates:
        different functions with the same growth rate may be represented using
        the same O notation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The letter O is used because the growth rate of a function is also
        referred to as the order of the function. A description of a function in
        terms of big O notation usually only provides an upper bound on the
        growth rate of the function.
      </p>
      <h3>
        3.- Arrays; N-dimensional arrays
      </h3>
      <p>
        In computer science a data structure is a data organization, management
        and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More,
        precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the
        relationships among them and the functions or operations that can be
        applied.
      </p>
      <p>
        Array is a set of data elements stored under the same name. Arrays can
        be created to hold any type of data and each element can be individually
        assigned and read.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can make a simil between arrays and vectors in the sense that they
        are linear, arranges of values, like one column or line, in computer
        science we can interpret each of these things as a dimension, so an
        array can have many dimensions, which mean more components to the
        address of a certain value, so you may have more complex data
        structures.
      </p>
      <p>
        These types of arrays are the math equivalent of matrixes, and used to
        represent almost anything.
      </p>
      <h3>
        4.- Qeues
      </h3>
      <p>
        In computer science, a queue is a collection in which the entities in
        the collection are kept in order and the principal (or only) operations
        on the collection are the addition of entities to the rear terminal
        position, known as enqueue, and removal of entities from the front
        terminal position, known as dequeue. Queues provide services in computer
        science, transport, and operations research where various entities such
        as data, objects, persons, or events are stored and held to be processed
        later. In these contexts, the queue performs the function of a buffer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Queues are common in computer programs, where they are implemented as
        data structures coupled with access routines, as an abstract data
        structure or in object-oriented languages as classes. They are ordered
        spaces where you "queue" things to later be dealt with. Usually
        processes for later computing. Queue usually are first in first off.
      </p>
      <h3>
        5.- Stacks
      </h3>
      <p>
        Is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements with
        two distinctive operations: Push: add an element to the end Pop: remove
        the last element This is also known as last in first out. It is a linear
        structure.
      </p>
      <h3>
        6.- Linked list
      </h3>
      <p>
        It is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by
        their physical placement in memory but by the previous element. Each
        space is occupied by two data pieces, the value stored and the address
        of the next this is called link. In order to access an element you have
        to go through all the previuos starting in the beginning until finding
        it.
      </p>
      <h3>
        7.- Merge Sort
      </h3>
      <p>
        This sorting algorithm uses divide and conquer strategy. It takes the
        list and reduces it until there is a list for each element, then begins
        comparing one two other making a new sorted list, then we comparing list
        by list and merging each one until we end with a complete list all
        sorted.
      </p>
      <h3>
        8.- Heap Sort
      </h3>
      <p>
        Sorting algorithm based on comparison, it finds the largest and stores
        it in an array and then goes on and find the next largest one and store
        it again until everything is sorted.
      </p>
      <h3>
        9.- Quick Sort
      </h3>
      <p>
        Quicksort is a divide and conquer algorithm. Quicksort first divides a
        large array into two smaller sub-arrays: the low elements and the high
        elements. Quicksort can then recursively sort the sub-arrays. The steps
        are: Pick an element, called a pivot, from the array. Partitioning:
        reorder the array so that all elements with values less than the pivot
        come before the pivot, while all elements with values greater than the
        pivot come after it (equal values can go either way). After this
        partitioning, the pivot is in its final position. This is called the
        partition operation. Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-array
        of elements with smaller values and separately to the sub-array of
        elements with greater values.
      </p>
      <h3>
        10.- Hashing
      </h3>
      <p>
        A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of
        arbitrary size onto data of a fixed size. The values returned by a hash
        function are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes.
        Hash functions are often used in combination with a hash table, a common
        data structure used in computer software for rapid data lookup. Hash
        functions accelerate table or database lookup by detecting duplicated
        records in a large file.
      </p>
      <h3>
        11.- Maps
      </h3>
      <p>
        An associative array, map, symbol table or dictionary is an abstract
        data type composed of a collection of (key,value) pairs, such that each
        possible key appears at most once in the collection.
      </p>
      <p>
        The classic example of these data structure is the dictionary, where you
